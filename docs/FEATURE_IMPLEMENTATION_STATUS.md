## Critical Implementation Gaps

1. **Route Optimization**: Currently at only 5-15% implementation. This is a critical functionality for efficiency that needs prioritization.

2. **Delivery Confirmation System**: At 20% implementation, we need a complete system for drivers to confirm deliveries with signatures and photo proof.

3. **Time Estimation**: At 10% implementation, we lack the ability to accurately predict delivery times based on route and stop duration.

4. **Driver Mobile Experience**: Only at 35% implementation, the mobile interface for drivers needs significant work to be production-ready.

5. **Capacity Planning**: At 45% implementation, we need better algorithms for optimizing driver loads and vehicle capacity.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Complete the RecurringOrderScheduler component for better visualization of recurring patterns

2. Implement the delivery confirmation system with signature capture and photo upload

3. Develop route optimization algorithm for automatic stop sequencing

4. Enhance mobile driver experience with real-time status updates

5. Build comprehensive capacity planning tools with volume calculations

6. Implement estimated delivery time calculations based on distance and historical data

7. Complete the PDF generation functionality with better formatting and branding

8. Fix the recurring order utilities TypeScript issues and ensure proper data handling

## Recent Updates
- Enhanced date display formatting with day names and MM/DD/YYYY format
