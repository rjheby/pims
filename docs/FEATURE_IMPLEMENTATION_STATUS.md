# Feature Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation status of all planned features in our scheduling system. It serves as a reference for project management and planning.

## Implementation Status Legend
- **Not Started (0%)**: Concept only, no implementation work has begun
- **Early Stage (1-25%)**: Initial design work or research has started, minimal code exists
- **In Progress (26-50%)**: Active development, core functionality partially implemented
- **Advanced Stage (51-75%)**: Most functionality implemented, testing and refinement in progress
- **Nearly Complete (76-99%)**: Feature is functional but requires final polishing or edge case handling
- **Complete (100%)**: Feature is fully implemented, tested, and ready for production use
