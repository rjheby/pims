# Project Overview: Delivery Management and Logistics System

## Project Vision

This delivery management and logistics system aims to streamline and optimize the entire delivery operation process for firewood and similar products. By providing powerful scheduling, routing, and capacity management tools, the system enables businesses to efficiently manage their delivery operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Target Users

The system serves multiple user roles within the delivery operation ecosystem:

1. **Dispatch Managers/Schedulers**: Users who create and manage delivery schedules, assign drivers, and resolve scheduling conflicts.

2. **Drivers**: Field personnel who execute deliveries and need mobile-friendly access to their routes, stops, and customer information.

3. **Administrative Staff**: Users who manage customer information, inventory, and reporting.

4. **Business Owners/Managers**: Users who need analytics and reporting on delivery operations, resource utilization, and financial metrics.

## Core Features

### Scheduling and Dispatch

- **Master Schedule Management**: Create and manage comprehensive delivery schedules 
- **Drag-and-Drop Stop Sequencing**: Intuitively organize delivery stops through a user-friendly interface
- **Multi-View Calendar Interface**: Toggle between monthly, weekly, daily, and list views
- **Color-Coded Capacity Visualization**: Instantly assess driver and vehicle capacity status
- **Recurring Order Management**: Efficiently handle standing orders on schedules (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)

### Capacity Planning

- **Driver Capacity Calculation**: Automatically calculate and visualize driver capacity utilization
- **Dynamic Load Calculation**: Real-time updates to capacity based on added/removed stops
- **Warning System**: Alert users when schedules exceed capacity constraints
- **Driver Preference Settings**: Configure driver-specific capabilities and preferences

### Route Optimization

- **Geographic Clustering**: Group deliveries by location to minimize travel time
- **Route Visualization**: Display optimized routes on interactive maps
- **Time Window Management**: Handle customer-specific delivery time requirements
- **Conflict Detection**: Identify and resolve scheduling conflicts

### Customer Management

- **Customer Database**: Maintain comprehensive customer information
- **Delivery Preferences**: Store and apply customer-specific delivery requirements
- **Order History**: Track past deliveries and customer preferences
- **Communication System**: Automate delivery notifications and updates

### Driver Management

- **Driver Scheduling**: Assign and manage driver schedules
- **Mobile Optimization**: Provide mobile-friendly interfaces for drivers in the field
- **Status Updates**: Real-time delivery status tracking and updates
- **Performance Metrics**: Track and analyze driver performance and efficiency

### Inventory Integration

- **Stock Availability**: Connect with inventory systems to verify product availability
- **Shopify Integration**: Synchronize with e-commerce platforms
- **Product Conversion System**: Manage product variations and packaging options

### Reporting and Analytics

- **Operational Reports**: Generate insights on delivery efficiency and resource utilization
- **Financial Tracking**: Calculate revenue, costs, and labor expenses
- **Performance Metrics**: Track KPIs related to delivery operations

## Implementation Approach

The system is designed with a modern tech stack including:

- React for the user interface
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for database and authentication
- TypeScript for type safety and code quality

The architecture emphasizes:

- **Responsive Design**: All interfaces work seamlessly across devices
- **Component-Based Structure**: Modular components for maintainability
- **Performance Optimization**: Fast loading and operation even with large data sets
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interfaces that require minimal training

## Development Status

The system is under active development with various features at different stages of implementation. Key components like drag-and-drop stop management and capacity planning are at advanced stages, while features like route optimization algorithms and mobile driver interfaces are in earlier stages of development.

A detailed breakdown of feature implementation status is maintained in the [Feature Implementation Status](./FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) document.

## Future Development

Planned enhancements include:

- **Advanced Route Optimization**: Incorporating traffic data and other real-time factors
- **Enhanced Mobile Experience**: Developing dedicated mobile applications for drivers
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Implementing machine learning for schedule optimization
- **Customer Portal**: Adding self-service options for customers
- **Advanced Analytics**: Expanding reporting capabilities with predictive analytics

## Integration Capabilities

The system is designed to integrate with:

- **E-Commerce Platforms**: Particularly Shopify for order synchronization
- **Accounting Systems**: For financial data exchange
- **Mapping Services**: For route optimization and visualization
- **Communication Systems**: For customer notifications
- **Inventory Management**: For product availability verification
