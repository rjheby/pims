# Tech Stack Document for Firewood Management System

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the technology choices made for the Firewood Management System project, designed to streamline firewood delivery operations. Each technology is carefully selected to ensure the system is efficient, versatile, and user-friendly.

## Frontend Technologies

The frontend is where users interact directly with the system. Our selected technologies ensure the interface is responsive, intuitive, and adheres to our brand standards:

*   **React**

    *   We chose React for its ability to create fast and dynamic web pages. It allows us to update content without reloading the page, delivering a seamless user experience.

*   **Tailwind CSS**

    *   A utility-first CSS framework that speeds up the styling process and ensures design consistency. It helps maintain the Woodbourne brand identity using specific colors like Woodbourne Green and Wood Brown.

*   **shadcn/ui**

    *   This is a collection of accessible UI components that integrate smoothly with Tailwind CSS, simplifying interface design while ensuring accessibility and cross-device compatibility.

*   **Hosting on Netlify**

    *   The frontend is hosted on Netlify, which provides automatic deployments and supports continuous integration with GitHub, ensuring that the frontend is always up to date.

These tools collectively craft an interface that is not only visually appealing but also intuitive across a variety of devices.

## Backend Technologies

The backend processes requests, manages data, and ensures that the system operates securely and efficiently:

*   **Supabase (PostgreSQL Database & Authentication)**

    *   A real-time database solution providing a strong PostgreSQL base, handling user authentication effortlessly. Supabase ensures secure data transactions and role-based access control.

*   **Node.js & Express**

    *   We use Node.js with Express to develop our REST APIs. Express offers a minimalist approach which is efficient for handling numerous API requests rapidly.

*   **Supabase Triggers and Subscriptions**

    *   These features enable real-time data updates, ensuring that changes are immediately propagated throughout the system.

These backend components work cohesively to ensure the application remains robust, scalable, and secure, addressing all operational needs reliably.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Effective infrastructure choices keep our system resilient and scalable, with easy deployment processes:

*   **Netlify**

    *   Chosen for deploying the web application, Netlify combines simplicity with powerful scaling capabilities, ensuring high availability.

*   **GitHub**

    *   Acts as our version control platform, facilitating collaboration, code reviews, and maintaining clean, efficient codebases.

*   **GitHub Actions**

    *   Used for automating our continuous integration and delivery pipelines, GitHub Actions help test and deploy updates seamlessly.

These infrastructure choices ensure the system is always up-to-date, secure, and ready to handle increased demand.

## Third-Party Integrations

Integrating with like-minded services enhances our project’s capabilities without needing to re-develop proven solutions:

*   **SMS Providers (e.g., Klaviyo or Audience Tap)**

    *   Integrates to deliver real-time updates to customers via SMS, ensuring timely delivery notifications.

*   **Mapping APIs (e.g., RouteMapper)**

    *   Provides optimal routing solutions for delivery efficiency, essential for dispatch operations.

*   **Shopify Integration**

    *   Automates the intake of customer orders directly into the dispatch system, streamlining the process.

*   **Planned QuickBooks Integration**

    *   Although for a later version, this will automate the invoicing process, increasing operational efficiency.

These integrations bring extra functionality that enhances user experience and operational capabilities.

## Security and Performance Considerations

We place significant emphasis on security and performance to protect data and deliver a fast user experience:

*   **Security Measures**

    *   **Role-Based Access:** Defined roles limit data access appropriately, protecting sensitive information.
    *   **SSL Encryption:** Ensures all data transmitted is secure, adhering to modern security standards.

*   **Performance Optimizations**

    *   **Real-Time Data Updates:** Via Supabase, ensuring minimal lag in data visibility.
    *   **Offline Capabilities for Drivers:** Drivers have offline access to essential data, ensuring their workflow isn't disrupted by connectivity issues.
    *   **Global Hosting with Netlify:** Guarantees quick page load times worldwide.

These considerations ensure that data is secure, system operations remain optimal, and user interactions are smooth and reliable.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In conclusion, the Firewood Management System's tech stack is designed for efficiency, scalability, and user satisfaction:

*   **Frontend:** Utilizes modern frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS to provide responsive, brand-compliant interfaces.
*   **Backend:** Built on Supabase and Node.js, offering robust data management and security.
*   **Infrastructure:** Leveraging Netlify and GitHub ensures automatic, secure deployments and seamless development processes.
*   **Integrations:** Enhance system capability with SMS, mapping, and eCommerce integrations, with future plans for financial management integration.

Overall, each choice in our tech stack supports the project’s aim of enhancing firewood delivery operations, ensuring the technology can meet all current and future demands while staying aligned with user and business needs.
