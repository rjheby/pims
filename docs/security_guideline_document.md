# Security Guidelines for Firewood Management System

This document outlines the security controls and best practices incorporated into the Firewood Management System to ensure robust security, resilience, and trustworthiness throughout its entire lifecycle.

## Overview

The Firewood Management System handles sensitive operational workflows including dispatch scheduling, driver management, inventory tracking, production logging, supplier orders, and reporting. With multiple user roles (Admin, Manager/Dispatcher, Bookkeeper, Driver, and Warehouse), secure design is essential. The following guidelines are embedded from the design phase and emphasize a secure-by-design approach.

## 1. Authentication & Access Control

*   **Secure Login & Password Management**

    *   Implement robust authentication using username and password with email-based password recovery.
    *   Enforce strong password policies (e.g., minimum length and complexity) and use secure password hashing (e.g., Argon2 or bcrypt) with unique salts.

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

    *   Define strict role permissions:

        *   **Admin**: Full access to all modules and reports.
        *   **Manager (Dispatcher/Bookkeeper)**: Access to scheduling and invoicing workflows.
        *   **Driver**: Access only to their assigned deliveries and personal payment info.
        *   **Warehouse**: Access limited to inventory and production logs.

    *   Validate tokens and permissions on every API request to ensure data is not exposed to unauthorized roles.

*   **Session Management**

    *   Use unpredictable session identifiers and secure storage (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure cookies).
    *   Enforce session timeouts (idle and absolute) and safe logout mechanisms.

## 2. Input Handling & Processing

*   **Input Validation**

    *   Assume all external inputs (user entries, API requests, file inputs) are untrusted.
    *   Validate and sanitize all inputs on the server side to prevent injection attacks (SQL/NoSQL, command injection, etc.).
    *   Use parameterized queries and ORMs to further protect against SQL injections.

*   **Output Encoding**

    *   Implement context-aware output encoding to protect against XSS.
    *   Define Content Security Policies (CSP) to further mitigate script injection risks.

*   **File Upload Security**

    *   Validate file types, sizes, and content where applicable.
    *   Prevent path traversal by sanitizing filenames and using secure file storage configurations.

## 3. Data Protection & Privacy

*   **Data Encryption**

    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Utilize TLS 1.2+ for secure communications.
    *   Never store sensitive data (passwords, PII, API keys) in plaintext.

*   **Strong Cryptographic Practices**

    *   Use industry-standard algorithms (AES-256 for encryption, SHA-256 for integrity) and incorporate secure hashing mechanisms for passwords.

*   **Secrets Management**

    *   Avoid hardcoding secrets in source code.
    *   Leverage dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., Supabase environment variables managed via `.env` files, dedicated secrets managers in cloud platforms).

*   **PII Handling & Compliance**

    *   Limit access to personally identifiable information based on role.
    *   Follow best practices and regulations (GDPR/CCPA) for data retention and deletion.

## 4. API & Service Security

*   **HTTPS Enforcement**

    *   Mandate TLS encryption for all API communications.

*   **Rate Limiting & Throttling**

    *   Implement mechanisms to protect against denial-of-service, brute-force, and credential stuffing attacks.

*   **CORS Configuration**

    *   Set up strict CORS policies that allow only trusted origins to access the APIs.

*   **Endpoint Protection**

    *   Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and validate method-specific inputs.
    *   Incorporate webhooks and third-party integrations (e.g., SMS notifications, mapping APIs) securely with proper authentication.

## 5. Web Application Security Hygiene

*   **CSRF Protection**

    *   Implement anti-CSRF tokens on state-changing requests to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.

*   **Security Headers & Cookie Settings**

    *   Deploy headers such as `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `X-Content-Type-Options`.
    *   Set cookies with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes to minimize risks.

*   **Error Handling**

    *   Ensure that error messages do not disclose sensitive information, and that errors lead to a safe fail state.

## 6. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

*   **Secure Server Configuration**

    *   Harden operating systems and application servers by disabling unnecessary services and patching known vulnerabilities.

*   **Cloud and CI/CD Security**

    *   Use Netlify as the cloud hosting platform with GitHub Actions for CI/CD which ensures that deployment steps are auditable and reproducible.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege by restricting access and server roles to necessary permissions only.

*   **TLS/SSL and Network Controls**

    *   Use updated TLS protocols and strong cipher suites on all connections. Disable outdated protocols such as SSLv3 and TLS 1.0/1.1.

## 7. Dependency Management

*   **Secure Libraries and Frameworks**

    *   Regularly scan and update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities. Use package lockfiles (e.g., package-lock.json) to control dependency versions.

*   **Third-Party Code Vetting**

    *   Rely on well-maintained and actively supported libraries (such as React, Express, and Supabase) to minimize external risks.

## Final Remarks

The security of the Firewood Management System is a multi-layered approach covering authentication, input validation, data protection, API security, and infrastructure hardening. Adhering to these guidelines ensures that even if one layer is compromised, additional safeguards remain to protect sensitive business data and maintain the integrity of operational workflows.

All implementations are to be reviewed regularly and tested against the latest threats. Error handling and logging must be configured to avoid information leakage while providing enough context for debugging and threat detection.

This comprehensive, secure-by-design approach allows the Firewood Management System to operate reliably in a cloud-based environment using Netlify, GitHub Actions, and Supabase, while safeguarding the data and privacy needs of all user roles involved.
