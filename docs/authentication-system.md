# Authentication System Documentation

## Phase 1 Implementation

This document outlines the authentication system implemented in Phase 1, based on the admin guide requirements.

### Role-Based System

The system implements a hierarchical role-based authentication system with the following roles (from highest to lowest permissions):

1. **Super Admin**: Complete system access including configuration
2. **Admin**: Full operational access excluding system configuration
3. **Manager**: Access to operations but limited administrative functions
4. **Warehouse**: Access to inventory and production functions
5. **Driver**: Limited access to delivery schedules and updates
6. **Client**: Access to their own orders and delivery information
7. **Customer**: Minimal access for end customers

### Guard Rails and Protection

The authentication system includes several guard rails to protect sensitive data and functionality:

1. **Route Guards**: Uses `AuthGuard` component to protect routes based on user roles
2. **Permission Checks**: `hasPermission()` function ensures users can only access features appropriate to their role
3. **Admin Mode**: Special mode for making system changes with visual indicators
4. **Session Management**: Automatic session handling with Supabase

### Authentication Flows

The system includes the following authentication flows:

1. **Login**: Email and password authentication via Supabase Auth
2. **Registration**: New user signup with role assignment
3. **Logout**: Secure session termination
4. **Redirection**: Automatic redirection to appropriate pages based on authentication status

### User Management

Admin users can manage other users via the User Management page:

1. **View Users**: List all system users with their roles and status
2. **Add Users**: Create new user accounts
3. **Edit Users**: Modify user information and roles
4. **Role Assignment**: Change user permissions by updating their role

### Admin Mode

As described in the admin guide, the system includes a special Admin Mode:

1. **Visual Indicator**: Red background overlay indicates when Admin Mode is active
2. **Confirmation**: Prompts for confirmation when exiting with unsaved changes
3. **Access Control**: Only users with appropriate permissions can enter Admin Mode

### Integration with Dispatch Functionality

The authentication system is integrated with the dispatch functionality:

1. **Driver Access**: Drivers can view their schedules
2. **Admin Controls**: Managers and admins can create and edit schedules
3. **Data Protection**: Row-level security ensures users only see appropriate data

### Technical Implementation

The authentication system uses the following components:

1. **UserContext**: Central context for user state and authentication functions
2. **AuthGuard**: Component for protecting routes based on role requirements
3. **UserMenu**: Dropdown menu showing user info and logout option
4. **Supabase Auth**: Backend authentication provided by Supabase

### Future Enhancements

Planned for future phases:

1. **Enhanced Profile Management**: Allow users to update their own profiles
2. **Multi-factor Authentication**: Additional security for sensitive accounts
3. **Activity Logging**: Track user actions for audit purposes
4. **Password Policies**: Enforce strong password requirements
5. **Session Timeouts**: Automatic logout after periods of inactivity
