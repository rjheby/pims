# Firewood Management System App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

New users begin their journey on a clean, branded landing page that immediately establishes the Woodbourne identity with its Woodbourne Green and Cream color scheme and prominent logo display. This page provides a direct link for both returning users and those who are new. For first-time users, a straightforward sign-up process is available where they can create an account using a simple form that requires a username and password, along with necessary details like email for account confirmation and password recovery. In addition to the standard email-based registration, social login options may be incorporated later for a smoother sign-up experience. Once a user has created an account, the system allows them to sign in with their credentials. If a user forgets their password, a clear “Forgot Password” link guides them through an email-based recovery process. Signing out is as simple as selecting the sign-out option available on every page once the user is logged in.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After logging in, the application directs the user to a role-determined landing screen that serves as the main dashboard. This dashboard immediately recognizes the user’s role—whether Admin, Manager (Dispatcher or Bookkeeper), Driver, or Warehouse staff—and presents a customized view. Admins see a comprehensive overview that includes analytics, schedule summaries, inventory reports, and configuration controls. Managers have a navigation bar and central panel that include tabs for dispatch scheduling, inventory management, production logging, supplier orders, and reporting analytics. Warehouse staff receive a screen focused on inventory and production details, while Drivers are provided with a streamlined, mobile-first interface that displays only their assigned delivery schedule with mandatory interactive elements like tap-to-call and clickable addresses. Navigation between these various sections is facilitated by a clearly defined header, side menus, and intuitive navigation cues that ensure the user always knows how to move from one module to the next.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

For the core dispatch scheduling function, Manager users acting as dispatchers start from the detailed schedule view. They begin by selecting the next delivery day which loads a duplicate of the previous week’s schedule as a template. From here, the dashboard presents a series of pages that allow the dispatcher to add, adjust, or remove orders. This includes manually entering missing orders, importing unprocessed orders from platforms like Shopify or internal systems, and updating order details such as quantities, delivery windows, cancellations, and client-specific notes. Once order adjustments are complete, the dispatcher proceeds to a dedicated driver assignment page where they review truck capacities, assign available drivers, and optimize the route for each driver by sequencing stops from farthest to nearest. As changes are made during scheduling, a real-time synced summary is provided to the warehouse, allowing them to monitor items that need to be prepared in accordance with the updated dispatch details. Throughout this process, the UI offers tools for bulk status updates to mark orders as scheduled, confirmed, or delivered. Once final changes are made, the dispatcher navigates to the review and finalize page where formulas and order-level details are verified before the schedule is dispatched via options such as email, WhatsApp, or SMS. For drivers, the mobile interface is minimalistic, caching their schedule offline. On this screen, they see essential delivery details and use interactive elements to update status, upload photos, or initiate communications with the client. Warehouse staff, on another page, have a production entry interface where they log production figures, record labor hours, and see a synchronized view of inventory levels that automatically adjust as dispatch orders change. The supplier orders module is reached through a dedicated tab where users responsible for inventory place manual orders, review the order details, and generate a PDF or shareable link to send the order to the supplier. Once supplier orders are confirmed, an automatic update page reflects the change in inventory levels. Lastly, the reporting and analytics dashboard offers pages with text-based summaries for varied metrics like revenue, cost of goods sold, and driver payments. This section allows users to set time filters and export reports to CSV or PDF. In every transition between these pages, clear navigation cues and consistent design make it easy for users to move back and forth without any disruption to their workflow.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can access the settings and account management section through a persistent access point on every page, usually via a header menu or an account icon. Within this section, users can update their personal information, change their password using secure email-based verification, and configure notification preferences for receiving SMS alerts about next-day ETAs and other significant updates. For users with billing or subscription roles, the settings page includes a sub-section for managing billing details or subscription options. The settings area is designed to be intuitive so that after making changes, users can easily return to the main work area through clearly labeled navigation buttons. This ensures that adjustments to personal or business settings do not interrupt the overall application flow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The system has robust error handling to ensure that users are promptly informed whenever an issue occurs. If a user enters incorrect login credentials, a straightforward error message appears guiding them to re-enter the correct information or use the password recovery process. During data entry, if invalid data is input into forms—whether in dispatch scheduling, manual order entry, or account settings—the interface provides immediate text-based feedback explaining the error and suggesting corrections. In cases of lost connectivity, especially on mobile devices used by drivers, the system displays an offline alert page for the driver mobile interface that indicates when the system is in offline mode and caches the most recent schedule data. If a user attempts to access a feature or page that is restricted to a different role, a clear permission error message is shown and the user is guided back to their home dashboard. These error states and alternate paths ensure that even when issues arise, the application maintains a clear, user-friendly flow so that users can quickly recover and continue their tasks.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The Firewood Management System app flow starts with a welcoming, branded login and simple account creation process. Once authenticated, users are taken to a customized dashboard that directs them based on their role—whether it is to manage comprehensive dispatch schedules, update driver statuses, record production logs, or manage supplier orders and financial reports. From there, every feature is seamlessly interconnected: dispatchers can easily replicate and modify past schedules, assign drivers with optimal routing, update statuses in real time, and share finalized schedules with stakeholders. Drivers benefit from a minimal, mobile-friendly interface that ensures they never miss an update even when offline, while warehouse staff have access to synchronized inventory and production tools to keep operations running smoothly. The settings and account management section is ergonomic enough to allow quick tweaks without disrupting the core workflow. Throughout every step, the system is geared toward preventing errors, providing clear navigational cues, and ensuring role-based access so that all users can perform their tasks without confusion. In essence, the entire journey—from initial sign-up to routine daily operations—has been designed to be clear, efficient, and purpose-driven, thereby streamlining management for a modern firewood delivery business.
